# ******* DEPRECATED REPOSITORY *******
This repository is publicly archived and will reach its EOL at the end of the year when it will be private and just available under request contacting our support team at [support@ftrack.com](mailto:support@ftrack.com).

We are currently moving our repositories to a new monorepo structure <https://github.com/ftrackhq/integrations>. 
The monorepo is currently private during the migration, but we are working hard to open it publicly as soon as we can.
Meanwhile, we will not do any new updates in the current repository.

Don't hesitate on contact our support team if you have any inquiries: [support@ftrack.com](mailto:support@ftrack.com)
